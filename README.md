# About

The Game of Life is a simulation of cellular automotons, evolution of the simulation is determined by the initial "seed".

The rules that drive the simulation are as follows:

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
